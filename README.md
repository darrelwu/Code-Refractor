## Horiseon Marketing Optimization

My motivation today is to alter the codebase so that it follows accessibility standards so that the website is optimized for search engines. In order to accomplish this goal the following problems must have been solved:

* **Semantic HTML** The HTML source code must follow the semantic HTML elements.
    1. Div for class header has been altered to the header element.
    2. Div for the unordered list inside the header has been replaced with the nav element.
    3. Changed the div classification for the "hero" image from css to image element.
    4. Changed the div classification for the main content to the main element.
    5. Changed the div id classification to section id classifications.
    6. Div in the footer was changed to the footer element. 
    7. All divs have been changed to more semantic HTML elements


* **Functional links** All source code links are performing as needed.
    1. Ensured every link is connected properly to the CSS code. 

* **Logical Structure** All source follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
    1. Ensured every element has a closing and have no open loops. 

* **Accesssible alt attributes** All alt attributes attribute to the images.
    1. Alt tags have been applied to the images inside the source code.
=
* **Correct heading attributes** All heading attributes follow an sequential order.
    1. H3 for the class benefits should be changed H2 because it is not nested under H2 and is instead nested under H1. 

* **Descriptive Title** All title elemnts are consise and contain an descriptive title. 
    1. The title element in the "head" has been changed to Horiseon Inc.

* **What did I learn?** 
    1. I learned that the main image "hero" is an image inserted via CSS which requires no alt tag. 
    2. I learned that at span can be used to utilize to group id attributes for styling purposes. 



## Usage
The usage of this source code is to demonstrate a more semantic source code that would perform more favorable to competitors in the same search engine.
